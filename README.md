# PyBaMM

This is a part of a project I done using the pybamm library of python.

PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) is an open-source battery simulation package written in Python.

PyBaMM consists of:
1. a framework for writing and solving systems of differential equations,
2. a library of battery models and parameters, and
3. specialized tools for simulating battery-specific experiments and visualizing the results.

Together, these enable flexible model definitions and fast battery simulations, allowing users to explore the effect of different battery designs and modeling assumptions under a variety of operating scenarios.
